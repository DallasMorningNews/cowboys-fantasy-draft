Nostalgia or numbers. That's the question you need to answer when building your fantasy Dallas Cowboys team.
Sure, you can go with guys like Tony Romo and Dez Bryant, who would rack up the points in a modern-day fantasy-football lineup. But which legendary quarterback would you want leading your ultimate Cowboys dream team? Troy Aikman has a few flashy reasons you might want to consider.
So spend a couple of minutes picking your fantasy team, but remember that the budget is limited. You have $21 to spend on six positions  -- don't worry, the kicker is free -- so choose wisely.
Let us know your dream lineup in the comments below, and make sure to share with your friends.
